# Blog Content

## Metadata

The first heading is blog title.
The first blockquote is description.

Create Date, Publish Date, Modify Date will be store in the form of Embedded HTML Comments.

The reason why I don't choose `Front Matter` is that the regular markdown render(Github, VSCode) can't display the full content. Blog title and description will be ignored by default.
