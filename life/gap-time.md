# What Happened During My Gap Time

> Enjoy my life, find my passion

## Resign to Family

I took the high speed train from Beijing to JiaXing in May 15, 2024, end up my journey of Beijing for 3 years. It's very happy to catch up anniversary with my lovely wife after few days.

At the beginning, I applied for teacher job, but I was not qualified cause of the mismatch of major and the graduation date limit. And I was planning to gap for nearly three months before the next job.

## Daily life

During this gap, I learned swimming by self-taught and seldomly coding with `leetcode`. Most of the time, I was playing games or watching animation. Of course, I still had to do the daily work. Do the laundry, cook the meal, etc.

## Special Forces Traveling

The third month, we traveled to a lot of places, including several towns near JiaXing, And as an accompanying person, taking advantage of the welfare of my wife's job, going to Xiamen for a five days trip, we had a lot of fun.Unfortunately, my wife got covid in the return, we had spent a tough week to recover. But we were still excited to make a schedule to travel to Japan. 7 Days, Tokyo ->  Kyōto -> Osaka.

## Puzzled to continue work as a developer

After we got married, we were separated for a year due to geographically reason, I still worked in Beijing, and my wife worked in JiaXing. As she mentioned, we couple stick together are important than everything. I really enjoyed these periods, and once considered retreating with my programming career, and switch to a steady and traditional career.

## Failed with the unified teacher certificate

Then I attended for the Unified Teacher Certificate Examination.And I finally failed due to my negative attitude for preparation. Because of the certificate won't affect the interview result of being a teacher, normally you should acquire the certificate within 2 years after join the school.

## Returning with the programming

I wrote my [cv](https://cv.wuchengwei.com) with solidjs, applied for Frontend developer job in JiaXing, and got nothing but message had been read. Fortunately, I still got three interviews outside JiaXing which I seldomly interested in. Before I resigning from ex-employer, I have some ideas but too hesitate to do anything. If programming continues, I want to choose what I really want to do.

## A quick interruption

As time went by, it soon comes to Dec 2024, a good chance happen to me that career school teacher position opened, and this time I was fully qualified. I checked the requirements carefully, analyzed the background seriously, and practice my presentation skills hardly. And I failed again at the start, the Written Test which basically a Chinese Language Exam. And my wife realized that maybe I really don't suitable for this career.

## Begin of my story

Up to this point, I finally get back to my own path, I write story, make vlog, build video pipeline, and publish [first video](https://youtube.com/shorts/B8RCwy6b3Jw), here, wcw's story begins.
