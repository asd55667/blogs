# Overview of my 2024

> This post is an overview of what I have done as a software engineer in 2024

## Summary

Up to mid of May 2024, I spent my last five months with my ex-employer, TAL. And then I made my resignation as planned to back to family.

After that, I gapped for a half year to find out what I really want to do. In the end of 2024, I have done some preparation for my new journey. And you will see my progress soon.

Besides, I will share a part of my coding in 2024.

## Target I made in 2024

At the beginning of 2024, I made some [targets](https://x.com/wcw82645854/status/1742206571697066207) with my programming learning path as below:

> I didn't finish all of them, but I will achieve them in some day. In practice, I used TDD to get test sets first, and then write code to make all test cases pass.

### improve fundamentals in cs ‚úÖ

I picked up test case from several base64 project in nodejs, and then write code to make all test cases pass. you could see details in [base64](https://github.com/asd55667/base64)

### bundler with webpack/rollup  üö´

Before I start [bundler](https://github.com/asd55667/bundler), I ignored the hard level and the time cost. And nowadays, the challenge of bundler is in a very low priority for me. If there is no necessary, I won't even try it.

### meta-framework witg next.js ‚úÖ

In 2023, I was so attracted by headless component with UI, and I have tried a little bit. During the burst of generative AI, I saw the demo cooperate LLM and [shadcn](ui.shadcn.com) together, it's super amazing, simultaneously, I realize that I have to skilled with next.js. So I started to learn next.js from scratch and have a lot of fun. I have a quick glance for documentation of [react.dev](https://react.dev/), and start my [nextjs-template](https://github.com/asd55667/nextjs-template).

### media player/editor ‚ùå

I had written an media editor demo with video frame only in my early career stage. I find passion about it, in leisure time of my ex-employment, I tried to implement media player for a while. But for now the priority is still not high.

### small project with rust ‚úÖ

In 2023, I heard of the point that front-end tool chain would be re written in rust.And I have read the first few chapters of [The Book of Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), but abort it up. In 2024, I continue the reading and have read the whole book, and finished [rustlings](https://github.com/asd55667/rustlings) exercises. By the end of the 2024, I reference the [openai-translate](https://github.com/openai-translator/openai-translator) to start my [wcw-recorder](https://github.com/asd55667/wcw-recorder) demo for learning rust and build the tool for myself. But the open sourced tool [OBS studio](https://obsproject.com/) is good enough and stable to achieve my current target, once facing the obstacle that OBS can not help, I will try to use rust to build it for my own.

### utilize ai with more efficiency ‚ùì

My ex-employer had provided the github copilot for a while, and I have been using it for learning and scripting. In [json-tutorial](https://github.com/asd55667/json-tutorial), I migrate test sets quickly from C.It really helps when writing structured code and writing tests. Fortunately, github copilot freely available now.

In the 4th quarter of 2024, I have also tried to use `Cursor`, `Windsurf` and `Cline`. Normally, I still use chatgpt client and perplexity mush more.

### blog ‚úÖ

After [nextjs-template](https://github.com/asd55667/nextjs-template), I started to make my blog site based on it.
And some idea in my mind comes up with headless CMS, I will open it in detail in another post. And now, my
blog site [wcw-blog](https://github.com/asd55667/wcw-blog) just ready, and you can visit it at [blog.wuchengwei.com](https://blog.wuchengwei.com).

### vps ‚úÖ

I have always been wondering an alternative self-hosted VPS to access global network, but I'm too lazy to do it. By the end of 2024, I already have one. And I will continuously maintain it as needed.
